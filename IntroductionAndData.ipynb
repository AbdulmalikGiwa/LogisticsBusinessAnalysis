        "A logistics company with numerous branches located in different states of the U.S.A is looking to expand to Canada and plans on starting the expansion with a few neighborhoods in Toronto, the company's main business model/strategy is setting up small outlets in neighborhoods and providing delivery services for businesses at relatively low prices, for each of its outlet the deliveries are limited to consumers within that region and hence the very low prices are feasible. The company needs to get an insight and understand the individual prospect of each neighborhood within a region in order to know which of these neighborhoods would the best fit for their business as regards the types of outlets within each neighborhood and the potential demand for the type of services that are offered by the company. The questions to be answered are :\n",

Foursquare API is a location data provider and can be used to get data on every venue/outlet within a given geolocation and the category to which the venue belongs to. The location in question for this analysis is Toronto which is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in canada. The following is a more detailed explanation:\n",

Each of the clusters will be examined with proper visualization tools and attempts will be made to see which of these clusters best fits the business needs of the company, if a conclusion cannot still be derived from the visual analysis then I'll proceed to use other neighborhoods outside Toronto that the company has recorded huge success in from it's previous operations in th U.S.A as a basis to build the company's profile for a recommender system using certain personal justifiable discretion to create ratings.\n",
